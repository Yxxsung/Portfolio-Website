# Portfolio-Website
This is the website for my portfolio. I started it on 08/27/2025 with the goal of showing off my artistic and coding skills to future employers. Where most will have a site created by Wix or Weebly, I intend to have a site I made entirely on my own to showcase my developing skills as it improves. Major updates will be described here.
